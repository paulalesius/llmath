* Introduction to Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: algebra-variables
:END:
Variables are a core concept in mathematics and programming. They are symbols or placeholders that can represent different values. Variables allow us to work with unknown or changing values in mathematical expressions and computer programs.

In mathematics, variables are often denoted by letters such as \(x\), \(y\), or \(z\). In programming, variables can have names like `num1`, `result`, or `name`. You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator <- or =. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
x <- 10   # Assign the value 10 to variable x
y = 5     # Also assigns the value 5 to variable y
#+END_SRC

* Constants and Their Role
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: algebra-constants
:END:
Constants are values that do not change. They are fixed and can be represented using variables. For example, the number \(\pi\) (pi) is a constant. We can use a variable \(r\) to represent the radius of a circle, and \(\pi\) to represent the constant value of pi. Then, the area of the circle can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \cdot r^2
\]

In R programming, you can declare a constant using the `const` keyword, but in practice, constants are often represented using regular variables with uppercase names.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
pi_value <- pi
radius <- 5
area <- pi_value * radius^2
#+END_SRC
