Factoring common factors involves identifying and extracting the greatest common factor (GCF) from a polynomial. This technique simplifies expressions and is fundamental in solving algebraic equations. The GCF of a set of terms is the largest expression that divides all of them without a remainder.

* Concept of Common Factors
  The common factor in a set of terms is a term that divides each of them evenly. The greatest common factor is the largest of these common factors. For example, in the expression \( 4x^3 + 8x^2 \), both terms are divisible by \( 4x^2 \), making it their GCF.

* Identifying the GCF
  To find the GCF of an algebraic expression:
  1. List the factors of each term.
  2. Identify the common factors.
  3. Choose the largest factor common to all terms.

* Factoring Out the GCF
  Once the GCF is identified, the expression can be rewritten as the product of the GCF and another expression. For instance, factoring \( 4x^3 + 8x^2 \) by its GCF \( 4x^2 \) gives \( 4x^2(x + 2) \).

* Examples
  Here are some examples of factoring common factors in algebraic expressions:

** Example 1: \( 6x^2 + 12x \)
   - Factors of \( 6x^2 \): \( 1, 2, 3, 6, x, x^2, 2x, 3x, 6x, 2x^2, 3x^2, 6x^2 \)
   - Factors of \( 12x \): \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, 12x \)
   - GCF: \( 6x \)
   - Factored form: \( 6x(x + 2) \)

** Example 2: \( 9y^3 - 3y^2 + 6y \)
   - Factors of \( 9y^3 \): \( 1, 3, 9, y, y^2, y^3, 3y, 9y, 3y^2, 9y^2, 3y^3, 9y^3 \)
   - Factors of \( 3y^2 \): \( 1, 3, y, y^2, 3y, 3y^2 \)
   - Factors of \( 6y \): \( 1, 2, 3, 6, y, 2y, 3y, 6y \)
   - GCF: \( 3y \)
   - Factored form: \( 3y(3y^2 - y + 2) \)

* R Code Example
  We can use R to visualize the process of finding GCFs. Let's plot a simple bar graph showing the factors of two numbers and highlight their GCF.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :file common_factors_example.png
x <- c(1, 2, 4, 8)
y <- c(1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18)
common_factors <- intersect(x, y)

barplot(c(table(x), table(y)), beside=TRUE, col=c(rep("blue", length(x)), rep("red", length(y))),
        legend.text=c("Factors of 8", "Factors of 18"))
abline(h=common_factors, col="green", lwd=2)
title("Common Factors of 8 and 18")
#+END_SRC

* Practice Problems
  - Factor out the GCF from the following expressions:
    1. \( 15x^4 - 25x^3 \)
    2. \( 7y^2 + 14y - 21 \)

Understanding and applying the concept of factoring common factors is crucial in algebra, especially when simplifying expressions and solving equations.
