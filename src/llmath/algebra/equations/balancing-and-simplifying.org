#+TITLE: Algebra - Balancing and Simplifying Equations

* Introduction
  In this section, we'll learn about balancing and simplifying algebraic equations. These are crucial techniques for solving equations effectively.

* Balancing Equations
** What is Balancing?
     - Balancing an equation means ensuring that the expressions on both sides of the equation are equal.
     - It involves adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing both sides of the equation by the same amount.
** Example: Balancing an Equation
     - Consider the equation: \( x + 3 = 7 \).
     - To balance, subtract the constant 3 from both sides: \( x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3 \), which simplifies to \( x = 4 \).

* Simplifying Equations
** What is Simplifying?
     - Simplifying an equation means reducing it to its simplest form.
     - This often involves combining like terms and eliminating unnecessary parts.
** Example: Simplifying an Equation
     - Consider the equation: \( 2x + 3x - 5 = 6 \).
     - Combine like terms: \( 5x - 5 = 6 \).

 * R Examples
 ** Example: Solving a Balanced Equation in R
 #+BEGIN_SRC R
 # Solve x + 3 = 7
 library(Ryacas)
 x <- ysym("x")
 y_fn(x + 3 == 7)

 ** Example: Simplifying and Solving in R
     #+BEGIN_SRC R
     # Simplify and solve 2x + 3x - 5 = 6
     solve(2*x + 3*x - 5 == 6)
     #+END_SRC

* Practice
  - Balance and solve the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 3x + 2 \).
  - Simplify and solve the equation: \( 4x + 2x - 10 = 12 \).
