* Introduction to Multi-Step Equations
Multi-step equations are algebraic equations that require more than one step to solve. These types of equations often involve multiple operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

** Key Concepts
   - Balancing the equation: What you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other.
   - Order of operations: Follow PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) rules.
   - Isolating the variable: The goal is to get the variable on one side of the equation.

* Solving Multi-Step Equations

* Practice Problems
Solve the following equations:

1. \( 4x - 7 = 21 \)
2. \( 5(x + 3) = 2x + 20 \)
3. \( 3x/2 - 6 = 9 \)
