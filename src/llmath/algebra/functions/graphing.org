#+TITLE: Graphing Functions in Algebra

* Introduction
  Graphing functions is a fundamental skill in algebra that helps in visualizing the relationship between variables. This document will guide you through the basics of graphing functions, with examples in R programming language.

* Basic Concepts
** What is a Function?
   A function is a relationship between two variables, typically x (independent variable) and y (dependent variable), where each x value is associated with exactly one y value.
   LaTeX: \( y = f(x) \)

** Why Graph Functions?
   - To understand the behavior of the function.
   - To find key features like intercepts, maxima, minima, and asymptotes.
   - To solve equations graphically.

* Graphing Functions using R
** Example: Graphing a Linear Function
   Let's graph the linear function \( y = 2x + 3 \).

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results graphics output file :exports both :file linear_function_plot.png
  library(ggplot2)
  x <- seq(-10, 10, by = 0.1)
  y <- 2 * x + 3
  ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x, y)) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Graph of y = 2x + 3") +
    xlab("x") + ylab("y")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Example: Graphing a Quadratic Function
   Now, let's graph a quadratic function \( y = x^2 - 4x + 4 \).

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results graphics output file :render both :file quadratic_function_plot.png
  library(ggplot2)
  x <- seq(-10, 10, by = 0.1)
  y <- x^2 - 4 * x + 4
  ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x, y)) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Graph of y = x^2 - 4x + 4") +
    xlab("x") + ylab("y")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Conclusion
  Graphing functions is a crucial skill in algebra, providing a visual understanding of mathematical relationships. Through practice and the use of tools like R, you can gain deeper insights into the behavior of various functions.
