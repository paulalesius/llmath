* Introduction
  In this section, we explore the various types of functions in algebra and their unique properties. Understanding these functions is crucial for applications in various fields, including artificial intelligence.

* Types of Functions
  ** Linear Functions
     - Definition: A linear function is a function of the form \( f(x) = mx + b \), where \( m \) and \( b \) are constants.
     - Example: \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \)
     - Properties: Linear functions have a constant rate of change and graph to a straight line.

  ** Quadratic Functions
     - Definition: A quadratic function is of the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants and \( a \neq 0 \).
     - Example: \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4 \)
     - Properties: Quadratic functions have a parabolic graph and a vertex. They represent accelerated growth or decay.

  ** Exponential Functions
     - Definition: Exponential functions have the form \( f(x) = a \cdot b^x \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants and \( b > 0 \).
     - Example: \( f(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x \)
     - Properties: Exponential functions grow or decay at a rate proportional to their current value.

* R Examples and Plots
  #+BEGIN_SRC R :file linear_function_plot.png
    library(ggplot2)
    x <- seq(-10, 10, by = 0.1)
    y <- 2 * x + 3
    ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Linear Function: f(x) = 2x + 3")
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  #+BEGIN_SRC R :file quadratic_function_plot.png
    y <- x^2 - 4*x + 4
    ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Quadratic Function: f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4")
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

  #+BEGIN_SRC R :file exponential_function_plot.png
    y <- 2 * 3^x
    ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + scale_y_log10() + ggtitle("Exponential Function: f(x) = 2 * 3^x")
  #+END_SRC

* Conclusion
  Understanding the types and properties of functions in algebra is essential for mathematical literacy and application in various fields. Through the examples and plots, we can visually appreciate the behavior of these functions.
