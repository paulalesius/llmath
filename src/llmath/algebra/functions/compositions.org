#+TITLE: Function Compositions in Algebra

* Introduction to Function Composition
  Function composition is a way of combining two or more functions to create a new function. In mathematical terms, if you have two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), their composition is denoted as \( (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) \).

* Basic Concepts
** Definition
   The composition of two functions \( f \) and \( g \) is defined as:
   \( (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) \)
   It means, first apply \( g \), and then apply \( f \) to the result of \( g \).

** Notation
   Function composition is denoted by a small circle between functions: \( f \circ g \).

* Examples
** Example 1: Basic Composition
   Let's consider two functions \( f(x) = x^2 \) and \( g(x) = x + 1 \). Find the composition \( (f \circ g)(x) \).

   Solution:
   #+BEGIN_SRC latex
   \begin{align*}
   (f \circ g)(x) &= f(g(x)) \\
                  &= f(x + 1) \\
                  &= (x + 1)^2
   \end{align*}

** Example 2: Using R for Composition
   We will define two functions in R and compute their composition.

   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file composition_plot.png
   f <- function(x) x^2
   g <- function(x) x + 1

   # Define the composition of f and g
   composition <- function(x) f(g(x))

   # Plot the composition
   x_vals <- seq(-10, 10, by = 0.1)
   plot(x_vals, sapply(x_vals, composition), type = 'l', main = "Plot of (f \circ g)(x)", xlab = "x", ylab = "(f \circ g)(x)")
