Absolute value inequalities involve expressions within absolute value symbols and are solved to find the range of values that satisfy the inequality. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. This concept leads to two different scenarios when solving absolute value inequalities: either the expression inside the absolute value is positive or it's negative.

* The Concept of Absolute Value Inequalities
  The equation \( |x| = a \) has two solutions: \( x = a \) and \( x = -a \). When this is extended to inequalities, we consider two separate cases for \( |x| < a \) and \( |x| > a \).

  - For \( |x| < a \), the solution is \( -a < x < a \). This represents a range of values.
  - For \( |x| > a \), the solution is divided into two parts: \( x > a \) or \( x < -a \). This is because the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative.

* Solving Absolute Value Inequalities
  1. Isolate the absolute value expression.
  2. Determine the type of inequality: '<' leads to a conjunction (AND), '>' leads to a disjunction (OR).
  3. Solve the inequality for both the positive and negative scenarios.

* Example: Solving \( |x - 3| < 5 \)
  - Isolate the absolute value: \( |x - 3| < 5 \).
  - Since itâ€™s a '<' inequality, use conjunction (AND): \( -5 < x - 3 < 5 \).
  - Solve for x: \( -2 < x < 8 \).

* R Code Example: Visualizing an Absolute Value Inequality
  #+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :file absolute_value_inequality_plot.png
    library(ggplot2)
    x_values <- seq(-10, 10, by = 0.1)
    y_values <- abs(x_values - 3)
    data <- data.frame(x = x_values, y = y_values)
    ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 5, linetype="dashed") +
      theme_minimal() +
      ggtitle("Graph of |x - 3| < 5")
  #+END_SRC

* Practice Problems
  - Solve and graph \( |2x + 1| > 3 \).
  - Solve \( |x - 4| \leq 6 \) and represent the solution on a number line.
  - For \( |3x - 5| < 7 \), determine the range of values for x.

This section provides a foundational understanding of absolute value inequalities, crucial for many mathematical applications. The combination of theoretical explanation and practical R examples helps to grasp the concept thoroughly.
