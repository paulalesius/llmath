Graphing inequalities is an essential part of understanding algebraic concepts. It helps in visualizing the solutions to inequality equations on a number line or coordinate plane. Unlike equations, inequalities do not have just one solution, but rather a range of solutions.

** What are Inequalities?

Inequalities are mathematical expressions involving the symbols < (less than), <= (less than or equal to), > (greater than), or >= (greater than or equal to). These symbols are used to compare two values or expressions. For example, \( x > 5 \) means that x is greater than 5.

** Graphing on a Number Line

Graphing an inequality on a number line gives a visual representation of all its possible solutions.

- To graph \( x > 5 \), we would draw an open circle at 5 and shade the line to the right of 5, indicating all the numbers greater than 5.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :file graph_number_line.png
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 10)), aes(x)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 10, y = 0, yend = 0)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = 5, y = 0), shape = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 5.1, xend = 10, y = 0, yend = 0), arrow = arrow(type = "open"))
#+END_SRC

** Graphing on a Coordinate Plane

Inequalities with two variables, like \( y > 2x + 3 \), are graphed on a coordinate plane.

- First, graph the equation \( y = 2x + 3 \) as if it were an equality.
- Since the inequality is \( y > 2x + 3 \), shade above the line to represent all the points where y is greater than \( 2x + 3 \).

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :file graph_coordinate_plane.png
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-10, 10)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) 2*x + 3) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 2*x + 3, ymax = 10), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2)
#+END_SRC

** Practice Problems

Try graphing the following inequalities:

1. \( x <= 4 \) on a number line.
2. \( y < -x + 2 \) on a coordinate plane.

Graphing inequalities is not just about drawing lines and shading areas; it represents a fundamental understanding of algebra and the solutions to inequalities. Practice is key to mastering this concept.
