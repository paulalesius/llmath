#+TITLE: Subtraction in Algebra

Subtraction is one of the fundamental operations in algebra. It represents the operation of removing objects from a collection. The result of a subtraction is called a "difference."

* Definition
   The subtraction of two numbers is the operation of finding the difference between them. If \( a \) and \( b \) are two numbers, the subtraction of \( b \) from \( a \) is written as \( a - b \).

* Properties
   - Subtraction is not commutative, i.e., \( a - b \neq b - a \) in general.
   - Subtraction is not associative, i.e., \( (a - b) - c \neq a - (b - c) \) in general.

* Examples in Algebra
   - If \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 5 \), then \( x - y = 10 - 5 = 5 \).
   - In terms of variables, \( a - b \) simply represents the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

* R Programming Examples
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
   # Example 1: Subtraction of two numbers
   a <- 10
   b <- 5
   difference <- a - b
   print(difference)

   # Example 2: Subtraction with variables
   x <- 15
   y <- 7
   result <- x - y
   print(result)
   #+END_SRC

* Practice
- If \( a = 8 \) and \( b = 3 \), what is \( a - b \)?
- Find the difference between \( x \) and \( 2x \).
In this expression, \( x \) and \( 2x \) are like terms because they both have \( x \) as the variable part. To combine them, we add their coefficients (keeping in mind the signs). The coefficient of \( x \) is 1 (since \( x \) is the same as \( 1x \)).

\( x \), or explicitly \( 1x \),can be read a "one quantity of X", so the practice problem can be read as "the subtraction of 2 quantities of \( x \) from 1 quantity of \( x \)".
- Find the difference between \( 1x \) and \( x \)
