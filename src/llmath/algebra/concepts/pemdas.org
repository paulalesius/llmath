#+TITLE: PEMDAS - Order of Operations

The acronym PEMDAS helps to remember the order of operations in algebra. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

* Parentheses
First, perform all operations inside parentheses.
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\[ (a + b) \times c \]
#+END_LATEX

* Exponents
Then, solve the exponents (or powers).
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\[ a^b \]
#+END_LATEX

* Multiplication and Division
Next, perform multiplication and division from left to right.
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\[ \frac{a \times b}{c} \]
#+END_LATEX

* Addition and Subtraction
Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
#+BEGIN_LATEX
\[ a + b - c \]
#+END_LATEX

* Examples in R
Let's see some examples of these operations using R programming language.

Evaluating an expression with all operations.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
# Expression: (3 + 2) ^ 2 - 4 * 2
result <- (3 + 2) ^ 2 - 4 * 2
print(result)
#+END_SRC

Evaluating a more complex expression.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
# Expression: ((2 * 3) - (4 / 2)) ^ 2 + 6
result <- ((2 * 3) - (4 / 2)) ^ 2 + 6
print(result)
#+END_SRC

You should know PEMDAS by heart, the order of operations is crucial for correctly solving algebraic expressions.
