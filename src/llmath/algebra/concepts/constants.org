* Introduction to Constants
  Constants are fixed values that do not change. In algebra, constants are often represented by letters, but their value remains the same throughout an equation or a problem. Common examples include numbers like \( 2, -5, \frac{3}{4} \), and mathematical constants like \( \pi \) and \( e \).

* Characteristics of Constants
  - Fixed Value: A constant represents a specific, unchanging number.
  - Symbol Representation: While they can be represented by any symbol, they are often denoted by letters like \( c, d, k \).

* Examples of Constants
  1. The number \( 5 \) in the expression \( 5x + 3 \) is a constant.
  2. In the formula for the circumference of a circle, \( C = 2\pi r \), \( \pi \) is a constant approximately equal to \( 3.14159 \).

* Using Constants in R
  Constants can be used in R to perform calculations. Below are examples demonstrating how to work with constants in R.

  #+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code
  # Define a constant
  a <- 5

  # Use the constant in an expression
  result <- a * 2 + 3
  print(result)

  # Mathematical constant pi
  circumference <- 2 * pi * 10
  print(circumference)
  #+END_SRC

* Conclusion
  Understanding constants is fundamental in algebra. They are used in various mathematical formulas and expressions, and recognizing them is crucial in solving algebraic equations.
