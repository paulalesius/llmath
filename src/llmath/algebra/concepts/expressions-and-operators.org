#+TITLE: Algebra Concepts - Expressions and Operators

* Expressions and Operators
  Algebraic expressions are combinations of variables, numbers, and operators. Operators are symbols that represent mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

** Basic Operators
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (*)
   - Division (/)

** Algebraic Expressions
   An algebraic expression combines both numbers (constants) and variables with operators. For example, in the expression \( 3x + 4 \), \( 3x \) and \( 4 \) are terms, \( x \) is a variable, \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) are coefficients and constants, respectively, and \( + \) is an operator.

** Examples of Algebraic Expressions
   - \( 2x + 3y \)
   - \( 4a - 7b \)
   - \( 5x^2 + 3x - 4 \)

* R Examples Using Org-Babel
  We will demonstrate some basic algebraic operations using R.

** Addition Example in R
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
     x <- 5
     y <- 3
     x + y
   #+END_SRC

** Subtraction Example in R
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
     x <- 10
     y <- 4
     x - y
   #+END_SRC

** Multiplication Example in R
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
     a <- 7
     b <- 2
     a * b
   #+END_SRC

** Division Example in R
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output
     a <- 20
     b <- 4
     a / b
   #+END_SRC

* Conclusion
  Understanding algebraic expressions and operators is fundamental in algebra. It involves knowing how to combine variables and constants with basic arithmetic operations to form expressions.
