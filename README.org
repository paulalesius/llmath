*** Who is this Book For?
This book is designed with beginners in mathematics in mind, especially those who are keen to explore the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the lens of mathematics. Whether you have a basic understanding of mathematics or are starting from scratch, this book is for you.

*** Status
- **Stage:** Early Development
- **Focus:** Building foundational content

** Emphasis on R Programming Language

Our journey will primarily utilize the R programming language as our tool for executing and understanding mathematical concepts. R is renowned for its powerful capabilities in statistical computing and graphics, making it an ideal choice for exploring the mathematics of Large Language Models (LLMs).

In addition to R, we will be leveraging Emacs Org mode extensively. Org mode is a unique and powerful feature of Emacs, providing an integrated environment for literate programming. It allows us to write documentation and executable R code in the same document, facilitating a seamless learning and development experience. This approach enables us to not only document the mathematical concepts but also to interactively execute and explore them using R within the Org mode environment.
